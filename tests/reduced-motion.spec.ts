/**
 * WCAG 2.3.3 guardrail: when the user has prefers-reduced-motion: reduce,
 * animated UI must not subject them to motion. The Results section's
 * AnimatedNumber is the canonical case — under reduced motion it should
 * render its final value immediately rather than counting up.
 *
 * NOTE: this spec calls `page.emulateMedia` explicitly *before* navigating
 * rather than relying on the `reducedMotion` test-fixture option. The
 * fixture is applied per-context but framer-motion's `useReducedMotion`
 * subscribes to the live media-query at mount time, so we set it before
 * the first paint so the component's `prefersReducedMotion` value is
 * `true` from the very first render.
